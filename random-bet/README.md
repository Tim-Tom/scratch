Solutions for a random puzzle mentioned in a [blog post][1]. Solutions made after reading
the problem description and before reading the rest of the writeup. Initial thoughts are
that it looks like a basic dynamic programming puzzle.

1. Store minimal distance to completion using player betting amounts.
2. Sort inputs to make key (which player is which doesn't matter since there is no turn order).
