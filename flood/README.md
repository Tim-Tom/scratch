A simple truly free game on android. You are given a board, a number of colors, and you
attempt to make the entire board one color by changing the color of the top left tile and
all tiles connected to it horizontally and vertically of the given color. The game gives
you a goal figure that I think can be achieved via something like a minimum spanning tree
and I want to play with it to find out.
