Let's maintain the assumptions of the previous question: parents keep having children
until they have one girl, at which point they stop; and babies are girls with probability
0.49.

If we select a child uniformly at random (from the entire population of children), what's
the probability he or she has exactly one sibling?

So like the previous problem we can consider an infinite string of
BGBGBGGGGBGBGBGGGBBBBGGGBGBGBG

We're looking for occurances of GBG in that string. Which have probability
`0.49*0.51*0.49` and we have two positions in that string that are valid, so two times
that amount.
