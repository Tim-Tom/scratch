You have a broken 12-hour analog clock on your wall: every sixty minutes the hour hand
moves forward by one hour with probability 9.99, but remains stuck with probability
0.01. The movements are independent across hours: the probability of move-stuck-move is
`0.99*0.01*0.99`, for example.

It is currently noon. We're interested in the probability that the hour hand points
towards 3, N hours from now. What does that probability converge to as N goes to infinity?

I presume this is setting up for some future problem. There's no bias towards any given
hour, so the probability at a random time in the future that it's pointing at the 3 is
1/12.
