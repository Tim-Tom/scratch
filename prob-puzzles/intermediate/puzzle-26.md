Income percentile ranks are numbers from 0 to 100 that indicate where you sit in the
income distribution -- for example, 75 would mean you earn more income than three quarters
of people, but less than the top quarter.

Let's assume a child's expected income percentile is a linear function of their parents'
income percentile. It turns out that the intercept is enough to pin down the slope. Do you
see why? If the intercept is 20, which means the lowest income parents have children who
end up at the 20th percentile, on average -- what is the slope?

We know the midpoint of the line has to be 50/50 because it's a population distribution.

So we have two points on a graph [0, 2] [5, 5]. That gives us a slope of 3/5.
