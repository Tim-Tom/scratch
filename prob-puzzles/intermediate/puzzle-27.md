You're carrying a one meter long piece of wood, when suddenly you trip and drop it on the
ground. How clumsy of you! The wood breaks into a left piece and a right piece, with the
breakpoint uniformly distributed length-wise; for any L between 0 and 1, the left piece of
wood has probability L of having a length less than L. For example, there's a 60%
probability that the left piece is less than 0.6 meters long.

What's the expected length (i.e. the average length) in meters of the longer piece?

The longer piece ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 with equal probability, so the mean is 0.75.
